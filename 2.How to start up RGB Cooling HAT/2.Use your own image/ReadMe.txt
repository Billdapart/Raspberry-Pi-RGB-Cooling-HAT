If you want to use your own image.
Please check [C programming ] or [Python programmingl].

As the author of WiringPi stopped updating the WiringPi library on August 6, 2019, WiringPi cannot be used in the new 64-bit system of Raspberry Pi, 
and C files cannot be compiled. 
If you are using the official 64-bit image of the Raspberry Pi, we recommend that you use the python code.
